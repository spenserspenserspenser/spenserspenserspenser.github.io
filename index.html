          TECHNODYSTOPIA: SCI-FI PREDICTING TECHNOLOGICAL FUTURES
    </div>
 
    <div class="text">
 The Replicants of Blade Runner, as the name suggests, are essentially AI systems given advanced bioengineered bodies designed to replicate the physical abilities and intellectual capacities of humans. Theyre put in dangerous scenarios without the need to risk actual human lives.
 
 Despite many advances in this technology, these highly intelligent androids are far from existing in our world. The technology today, three years after the setting of Blade Runner, is still far from creating actual Artificially Intelligent beings.
 Beings like this sometimes called general AI are beyond the scope of our modern AI systems and technologies available today.
 AI, as we know it, consists of technologies like machine learning algorithms, natural language processing and computer vision technologies. This can work in surprising and sophisticated ways by identifying patterns and correlations to predict outcomes.

 But AI is very far from understanding humans or having its own thoughts and feelings. The robots we interact with are more likely to be the cute but inert Paro aged care seal or the somewhat creepy Boston Dynamic dancing dog.
 While technologists might still mull over the existence of potentially dangerous almost humans that are nearly impossible to distinguish from real humans, experts in the field are more concerned about the hidden black box workings of manipulative and prejudiced algorithms that are making decisions about our jobs, money and freedom.
 Experts are concerned too over the digital platforms sitting in moats of data that give them the ability to manipulate what we buy or how we vote.
