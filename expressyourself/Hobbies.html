              I have the opportunity to express myself in music because there's no boundaries creatively. Whereas some other professions are very regimented and might have set tasks that you. With music there's no boundaries. So whenever I'm going to make a song, I really don't know what's going to happen and that's kind of exciting to me. Yeah, that freedom of just being able to express yourself off, create new sound.

              It sounds like a cliche, but the reason it feels like play and not work is because I just love it so much. Simple as that. I've been doing it since I was eleven years old and it's just a part of my life that I'll never leave. No matter what happens in my musical journey.

              It doesn't feel like work. Like when you have deadlines or whatever, it's still just fun. You're still making music, being creative, being able to express yourself. And it's really important for me. And I feel like with everything else going on in life, for me, when I sit down in the studio, that's when I feel truly myself and I have pure freedom. And, yeah, I just feel honestly, it doesn't feel like work because I love it so much. Simple as that.
