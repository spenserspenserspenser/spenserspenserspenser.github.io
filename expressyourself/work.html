              I feel like it's hard to say whether I can or I cannot express myself in my work life at the moment. The position I am is marketing, I think it takes time to build a portfolio and your career out and your understanding of process is. I am expressing myself in the way that I work. Although, I have to adapt, learn and overcome to get to that next point where I feel like I can truly express myself.

The reason why it feels like play is because t is involved around running and I'm an avid runner. You see, you know, on occasion I have been working and running at the same time. if we're down in a competition or down for an event even talking about running just for me feels like play. I still feel like it is play just because it does come so naturally. It is something that I could literally articulate over and over and over again, and it will always end with the same thing. Just go run.
