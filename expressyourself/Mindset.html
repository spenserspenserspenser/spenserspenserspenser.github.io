             I feel like I have the opportunity to express myself in a creative and freedom aspect but when it comes to finances, it’s a little bit more restrictive. It sorta holds back my larger ideas with other people, and rightfully so - not everyone can do work or collaborate for free, people deserve to earn for their art, there’s bills to be paid haha
<br> <br>
It feels like play 90% of the time, the other 10% is set behind promo and event design for gigs or releases. I know a few people who would probably say it’s 50/50 for them but for me I sorta have the belief that if you do cool shit and you’re open about it, people will find it eventually
